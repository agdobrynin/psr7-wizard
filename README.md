## Installation

```shell
composer kaspi/psr7-wizard
```

## Usage

```php
// Example build ServerRequest class with package kaspi/http-message

$httpFactory = new \Kaspi\HttpMessage\HttpFactory();

$wizard = new \Kaspi\Psr7Wizard\ServerRequestWizard(
    serverRequestFactory: $httpFactory,
    streamFactory: $httpFactory,
    uploadedFileFactory: $httpFactory,
    uriFactory: $httpFactory,  
);

/** @var \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface $serverRequest */
$serverRequest = $wizard->fromGlobals();

//👆🏻 Or create by params
$uploadedFiles = [
    $httpFactory->createUploadedFile('/tmp/file1');
];

$wizard->fromParams(
    serverParams: $serverEnv,
    queryParams: $queryStringParams,
    cookieParams: $cookie,
    files: $uploadedFiles,
    parsedBody: $parsedBody,
    body: 'raw content'  
);
```

## Development environment

- [Local development](#local-development) (without Docker)
- [With Docker images](#using-docker-image-with-php-81-82-83) (WSL, Linux)

## Local development

Required PHP 8.1, php Composer 2.x

### Testing
Run test without code coverage
```shell
composer test
```
Running tests with checking code coverage by tests with a report in html format
```shell
./vendor/bin/pest
```
Requires installed [PCOV](https://github.com/krakjoe/pcov) driver

_⛑ the results will be in the folder `.coverage-html`_

### Static code analysis

For static analysis we use the package [Phan](https://github.com/phan/phan).

Running without PHP extension [PHP AST](https://github.com/nikic/php-ast)

```shell
./vendor/bin/phan --allow-polyfill-parser
```

### Code style
To bring the code to standards, we use php-cs-fixer which is declared
in composer's dev dependencies.

```shell
composer fixer
```

## Using Docker image with PHP 8.1, 8.2, 8.3

You can specify the image with the PHP version in the `.env` file in the `PHP_IMAGE` key.
By default, the container is built with the `php:8.1-cli-alpine` image.

Build docker container
```shell
docker-compose build
```
Install php composer dependencies:
```shell
docker-compose run --rm php composer install
```
Run tests with a code coverage report and a report in html format
```shell
docker-compose run --rm php vendor/bin/pest --compact
```
⛑ the results will be in the folder `.coverage-html`

Phan (_static analyzer for PHP_)

```shell
docker-compose run --rm php vendor/bin/phan
```

You can work in a shell into a docker container:
```shell
docker-compose run --rm php sh
```
##### Using Makefile commands.
Check and correct code style:
```shell
make fix
```
Run the static code analyzer:
```shell
make stat
```
Run tests:
```shell
make test
```
Run all stages of checks:
```shell
make all
```
